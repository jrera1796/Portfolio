    In 2020 the world as I knew it changed. The hustle and bustle that once gave life to The City quickly shifted into silence and uncertainty. During these times I had the opportunity to take a deep breath and reflect on the things I wanted to do.
    As a kid I enjoyed taking things apart and putting them back together or 'MacGyvering' something out of the miscellaneous parts. I'd have to admit I still enjoy analyzing how things work the way they do. I've always been fond of computers and would spend the wee hours of the night exploring everything I could find.  </p>

  <p>Over the years my interests have ranged, from studying psychology, taking photography, producing digital music, to 3D modeling...the list goes on. What I've noticed is that I gravitate towards things that require attention to detail.</p>
